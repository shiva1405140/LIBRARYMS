# 📚 Library CRUD UI - Django Management System

A robust Library Management System built with **Django**, featuring a dual-architecture approach. This project demonstrates how to handle book data using traditional Django templates and modern RESTful APIs, all wrapped in a custom "Binary/Matrix" themed interface.



## 🚀 Features
* **Full CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete books.
* **Hybrid Views:** Implementation using both **Function-Based Views (FBVs)** for simple logic and **Class-Based Views (CBVs)** for scalability.
* **REST API:** Integrated **Django REST Framework (DRF)** for programmatic data access.
* **Dynamic UI:** A custom sci-fi/tech-themed interface (as seen in screenshots).
* **Date Management:** Integrated date picker for tracking publication or entry dates.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Backend:** Django 5.x
* **API Framework:** Django REST Framework (DRF)
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Matrix/Binary background), JavaScript
* **Database:** SQLite (Default)
